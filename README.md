<h1>Personal Website</h1>

- This is the code for the first attempt at an online portfolio. This is coded in HTML and CSS, demostrating an understanding of the language and styling.


- The idea behind this website is to have static elements and a text container that moves as you scroll. In this container is where you find all the information that is wanting to be displayed by the website. There is a navbar at the top that has linked elements that direct you to specific IDs for sections withing the text container.
